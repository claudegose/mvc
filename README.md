ðŸŒ± Must-have features

Step 1: have a look around

First, read the code provided in the starter pack. It's well documented with comments. Try to follow the track of the homepage. Can you follow the path to the view?

Know what you Google for: modal or model? A modal is a popup window, a model is part of the MVC structure. Or your future boy/girlfriend.
Step 2: preparation

For this exercise, you'll need a database with an articles table. Add three fields:

title (VARCHAR, 255)
description (TEXT)

The homepage from the starter pack works and provides a link to the articles page. The articles > index view contains a nice overview of the articles, but does not have the data. Finish all the TODO's in the controller to provide the required info.

** Alright, then... is there always a catch? The answer is simple: yes.
Best of luck! I hope you'll be able to end with these famous words:
